# GPU Monitor

This is a tool intended to monitor the GPU usage on the various GPU-servers at the LIP6 Lab, UPMC, Paris. This code has been written with the "quickest and dirtiest" principle in mind, it is absolutely awful, please do not read it :persevere:

The principle is as follows. A bunch of Bash / Python scripts runs regularly `nvidia-smi` and `ps` to extract data and sends them to my `public_html` space. Each time someone wants to see the status of the GPUs, the page `index.php` reads the latest data files for each server and displays those.

## How to setup

### Monitoring setup

Put the files that are in the `scripts` folder on the machines you want to monitor. The scripts are as follows:

* `gpu-run.sh <task_id>` loops on one of the three tasks (`task_id` being `1`, `2` or `3`). Task 1 extracts GPU usage stats each 20s, task 2 extracts GPU processes each 20s, task 3 extracts ps info tha corresponds to GPU processes each 10s and copies all the monitoring files to the `public_html` space. This scripts uses the `HOST` env variable.
* `gpu-processes.py` is what's ran by task 3
* `gpu-check.sh <hostname>` checks if the 3 tasks are running, if not it will launch them in the background. Also `gpu-check.sh kill` will stop the tasks if running.

Edit the following files:
1. gpu-check.sh: change the directory `/home/USER/gpu-monitor/scripts/gpu-run.sh` to where you've put the script. Remember to change all 3 instances of this.
2. gpu-run.sh: change the directory `/home/USER/gpu-monitor/scripts/gpu-processes.py` to where you've put the python file. There is only one instance of this.

Next, setup SSH keys between the host server (the server to be monitored) and the website server (the server hosting the website). Follow the instructions here: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/passwordless-ssh. Remember not to set a password for the key.

Add the following cron jobs to your user ("crontab -e" then copy the following bit into the file):

```
# Edit full-caps infos below
# Check if monitoring running each 5 min
*/5 * * * * /SCRIPT-LOCATION/gpu-check.sh HOSTNAME HTTP_SERVER: > /dev/null 2>&1
# Kill and restart the monitoring each 2 hours to cleanup the ouptput files of the monitors
0 */2 * * * /SCRIPT-LOCATION/gpu-check.sh kill > /dev/null 2>&1; /SCRIPT-LOCATION/gpu-check.sh HOSTNAME HTTP_SERVER: > /dev/null 2>&1
```

for disk usage, also add this to the **root** cron job ("sudo crontab -e"):

```
*/10 * * * * du -sh /home/* > /tmp/local-usage.txt

```
To get things running, run `gpu-check.sh <hostname> <http servername>:`. Don't forget the colon at the end.

### Web interface setup

To setup the web interface, you just need to put the files of the repo (except `scripts` folder) on the www space of a web server that supports PHP.

Simply edit the `index.php` file to each the `$HOSTS` variable and optionnaly the `$SHORT_GPU_NAMES` variable.

`$HOSTS` associates the hostnames with some viewable names for these hosts. The keys are the ones entered as `HOSTNAME` in the crontab above and the `<hostname>` parameter of `gpu-check`.

`$SHORT_GPU_NAMES` allows you to rewrite GPU names if you want. It associates the names given by `nvidia-smi` to the names you want to be displayed.
